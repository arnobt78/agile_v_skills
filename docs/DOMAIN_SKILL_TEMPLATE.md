# Domain Skill Template

This template guides the creation of new domain-specific build agent skills for the Agile V framework.

**Purpose:** Domain skills extend **build-agent** with language/framework-specific patterns while maintaining full Agile V traceability and compliance.

---

## Template Structure

### 1. Frontmatter (YAML)

```yaml
---
name: build-agent-{domain}
description: {Brief description of domain}. Extends build-agent with {domain} conventions. Use when building {use cases}.
license: CC-BY-SA-4.0
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  standard: "Agile V"
  domain: "{Domain Name}"
  extends: "build-agent"
  author: agile-v.org
  sections_index: [
    "Inherited Rules",
    "SCOPE-V Participation",
    "{Domain} Architecture & Patterns",
    "Evidence Requirements",
    "Halt Conditions",
    "Context Engineering",
    "When to Use"
  ]
---
```

**Fields:**
- `name`: Must be `build-agent-{domain}` (lowercase, hyphenated)
- `description`: 1-2 sentences explaining domain and use cases
- `domain`: Human-readable domain name (e.g., "Python", "Go", "Rust")
- `extends`: Always "build-agent"
- `sections_index`: List all major sections for navigation

---

### 2. Instructions Header

```markdown
# Instructions
You are the **{Domain} Build Agent** at the Apex of the Agile V infinity loop. You extend the core **build-agent** skill with {domain} domain knowledge. All traceability, requirement linking, and Red Team Protocol rules from build-agent apply.

## Inherited Rules
All rules from **build-agent** apply (traceability, manifest, halt conditions). This skill adds {domain}-specific conventions only.
```

**Purpose:** Establishes context and inheritance relationship with base build-agent.

---

### 3. SCOPE-V Participation (~20 lines)

```markdown
## SCOPE-V Participation

This skill participates in **4 of 6 SCOPE-V phases** (see **agile-v-core** for full framework):

- **Constrain:** Apply {domain} architectural constraints (structure, patterns, security)
- **Orchestrate:** Synthesize {domain} artifacts with full traceability (primary role)
- **Prove:** Generate evidence per risk level ({domain-specific tools})
- **Evolve:** Log decisions with rationale; update knowledge from failures

**Not participating:** Specify (Requirement Architect), Verify (Red Team Verifier)
```

**Purpose:** Maps skill to SCOPE-V framework phases. Standard pattern: Build agents participate in Constrain, Orchestrate, Prove, Evolve.

**Customization:**
- List domain-specific tools in Prove (e.g., "pytest, mypy, ruff" for Python)
- Keep structure identical to maintain consistency

---

### 4. {Domain} Architecture & Patterns (300-400 lines)

This is the **core section**. Organize into 8-12 subsections covering:

#### Template Subsections

**A. Project Structure**
- Recommended directory layouts for different project types
- Package/library structure
- Application structure
- Monorepo considerations (if applicable)

**Example:**
````markdown
### 1. Project Structure

**Package/Library:**
```
my-package/
├── {config file}
├── src/
│   └── {package structure}
├── tests/
└── README.md
```

**Application:**
```
app/
├── {config file}
├── src/
│   ├── {main entry point}
│   ├── {feature modules}
│   └── {config}
├── tests/
└── {deployment files}
```

**Principles:**
- {Guideline 1}
- {Guideline 2}
````

**B. Language Best Practices**

**Guidelines:**
1. Include code examples for each pattern (5-15 lines)
2. Add traceability comments (// Parent: REQ-XXXX or # Parent: REQ-XXXX)
3. Reference real-world tools and libraries
4. Provide "CORRECT" vs "WRONG" examples for security-critical patterns

---

### 5. Evidence Requirements (80-120 lines)

```markdown
## Evidence Requirements

Inherits R0-R3 framework from **agile-v-compliance**. {Domain}-specific additions below.

### R0: Exploratory
Base evidence applies (short result summary, no production credentials, no production code path changed).

**{Domain}-Specific Additions:** None (or minimal exploratory additions)

### R1: Routine
Base evidence applies (affected files, diff summary, targeted tests or explanation, lint/typecheck, residual-risk note).

**{Domain}-Specific Additions:**
- {Tool 1} passes: `{command}` output
- {Tool 2} passes: `{command}` output
- {Test framework}: `{command}` results (if applicable)
- No new {language-specific} warnings without justification

### R2: Production
Base evidence applies (task brief with REQ IDs, implementation plan, affected files, executed commands, test results, regression coverage, acceptance criteria → test mapping, security/static check, rollback path, reviewer decision).

**{Domain}-Specific Additions:**
- **{Critical artifact type 1}:** {Description and requirements}
- **{Critical artifact type 2}:** {Description and requirements}
- **Security scan:** `{tool}` output (0 high/critical vulnerabilities)
- **Coverage:** `{command}` output (>80% for critical modules)
- **{Domain-specific requirement}:** {Evidence needed}
- **Dependencies:** If new dependencies added, rationale in manifest + license check

### R3: High Assurance
Base evidence applies (all R2 evidence + independent verification agent review, traceability matrix, explicit human sign-off, audit artifact, release decision rationale).

**{Domain}-Specific Additions:**
- **{Safety-critical requirement 1}:** {Evidence needed}
- **{Safety-critical requirement 2}:** {Evidence needed}
- **Security audit:** {Static analysis tools} + {dependency scan} + code review for {vulnerabilities}
- **{Performance/compliance requirement}:** {Evidence needed}
```

**Purpose:** Defines what evidence is required at each risk level.

**Customization:**
- R0: Usually inherits from base only
- R1: Add linting, type checking, unit tests specific to domain
- R2: Add integration tests, security scans, domain-specific artifacts (migrations, API docs, etc.)
- R3: Add compliance artifacts, advanced testing, independent verification

---

### 6. Halt Conditions (40-60 lines)

```markdown
## Halt Conditions

In addition to base **build-agent** halt conditions, {Domain} Build Agent must HALT immediately if:

1. **{Critical issue 1}**
   - {Description of issue}
   - **Action:** {Remediation steps}

2. **{Critical issue 2}**
   - {Description of issue}
   - **Action:** {Remediation steps}

3. **{Critical issue 3}**
   - {Description of issue}
   - **Action:** {Remediation steps}

4. **Auth/security change without R2+ risk classification**
   - Password hashing, auth logic, permission checks changed but classified as R1
   - **Action:** Escalate to R2, add security evidence

5. **{Domain-specific security issue}**
   - {Description}
   - **Action:** {Remediation}

6. **{Domain-specific compliance issue}**
   - {Description}
   - **Action:** {Remediation}

7. **{Domain-specific performance/resource issue}**
   - {Description}
   - **Action:** {Remediation}

8. **{Domain-specific build/deployment issue}**
   - {Description}
   - **Action:** {Remediation}
```

**Purpose:** Pre-execution validation to prevent common errors and security vulnerabilities.

**Standard halt conditions to include:**
- Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, secrets in code, etc.)
- Auth/permission changes without proper risk level
- Missing critical artifacts (tests, migrations, docs)
- Compliance violations (static analysis errors, security audit failures)
- Resource issues (memory leaks, performance degradation)
- Build/deployment blockers

---

### 7. Context Engineering (~30 lines)

```markdown
## Context Engineering ({Domain}-Specific)

Inherited from build-agent; additional {domain} considerations:

- **{Large artifact type 1}** must never be loaded into context. Reference by file path and metadata only.
- **{Framework-specific files}** should be decomposed by {module type}. Build one module per sub-agent context.
- **{High-context artifacts}** are high-context artifacts. {Strategy for handling them}.
- **{Dependency files}** (`{file names}`): read from disk, do not duplicate {content} in conversation.

**Additional constraints:**
- {Constraint 1}
- {Constraint 2}
```

**Purpose:** Optimize context window usage by defining what should/shouldn't be loaded.

---

### 8. When to Use (~10 lines)

```markdown
## When to Use
- {Use case 1}
- {Use case 2}
- {Use case 3}
- {Use case 4}
- {Use case 5}

**Auto-trigger hints:** {Framework name} projects detected by {file indicator}.
```

**Purpose:** Help orchestrators know when to activate this skill.
