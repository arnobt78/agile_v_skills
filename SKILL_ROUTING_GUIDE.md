3. **`observability-planner`** — Log incident (INC-XXXX)
4. Root cause analysis → identify REQ gap
5. **`agile-v-lifecycle`** — Create CR-XXXX

## Tips for Effective Skill Use

1. **Always start with `agile-v-core`** — It sets foundational values and directives.

2. **Discovery before requirements** — Run `discovery-analyst`, `threat-modeler`, `ux-spec-author` *before* `requirement-architect` for complete requirements.

3. **Parallel synthesis** — Run `build-agent-*` and `test-designer` in parallel (fresh context each) for speed.

4. **Independent verification** — Never let `red-team-verifier` inherit context from `build-agent` (prevents bias).

5. **Continuous compliance** — `compliance-auditor` can observe all stages; doesn't block workflow.

6. **Sprint-based flexibility** — Use `agile-v-product-owner` to break large cycles into manageable sprints.

7. **Post-release rigor** — Don't skip `release-manager` and `observability-planner` — they close the feedback loop.

8. **Security shifts left** — Run `threat-modeler` early (before code) to catch threats before implementation.

9. **Multi-cycle evolution** — Use `agile-v-lifecycle` for Cycle 2+ to manage change requests and versioning.

10. **Context optimization** — Load only the skills you need for the current stage; use file paths in handoffs (not full file contents).

## Troubleshooting

**"I'm not sure which skill to use"**
- Start with `agile-v-core` for foundational guidance
- Check the Quick Reference Table above
- When in doubt, ask: "What phase am I in?" (Discovery → Requirements → Synthesis → Verification → Release)

**"Can I skip a skill?"**
- Discovery skills (discovery-analyst, threat-modeler, ux-spec-author): Optional if requirements are already clear
- `requirement-architect`: Required (no REQs = no traceability)
- `logic-gatekeeper`: Required (prevents ambiguous REQs)
- `build-agent-*`: Required for code generation
- `test-designer`: Required for independent verification
- `red-team-verifier`: Required (Gate 2 depends on it)
- `release-manager`, `observability-planner`: Recommended for production deployment
- `compliance-auditor`: Recommended for audit trail (required for regulated industries)

**"Skills seem to overlap"**
- `requirement-architect` vs `discovery-analyst`: Discovery analyzes messy inputs; Requirement Architect formalizes them
- `build-agent` (core) vs `build-agent-python`: Core is language-agnostic; domain-specific extends it
- `release-manager` vs `observability-planner`: Release handles deployment; Observability handles monitoring
- `agile-v-pipeline` vs `agile-v-lifecycle`: Pipeline orchestrates stages within a cycle; Lifecycle manages multiple cycles

**"How do I know when to move to the next skill?"**
- Each skill produces a **handoff artifact** (REQUIREMENTS.md, BUILD_MANIFEST.md, VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md, etc.)
- Wait for **Human Gate approval** before proceeding past Gate 1 or Gate 2
- Check **Halt Conditions** in each skill — if any are true, stop and resolve before proceeding
